## About Me üìù

Infrastructure Analyst turned software developer, self-teaching myself a fullstack skillset. I have been coding for more than a year consistently, starting with Solidity and eventually moving onto Python. I find back end development easier than front end, and am working to improve my front end skills. I have a deep dedication to teaching myself how to excel as a programmer with the end of goal of contributing to Machine Learning and Distributed Networks as Infrastructure such as blockchain technology.

My learning approach is project-oriented, a method I find particularly effective for gaining practical experience and understanding. After navigating Python courses and getting a good grasp on the Python syntax I began just building projects. I now have a more direction oriented approach to learning, and am improving my ability to think in an iterative way - whilst improving on core development fundamentals. 

## My Tech Stack üíª

My primary programming language is Python and SQL. I also have some proficiency in reading Solidity, and am learning Javascript.

## Current Learning Focus üéØ

- Advanced Python: To deepen my understanding and broaden my capabilities with the end goal of being able to contribute to Machine Learning.
- Solidity: To gain a more comprehensive understanding of smart contract development, and how immutable systems can be used to solve current problems.
- Learn Web Development: To learn how to develop usable front end interfaces.
- Data Science and Engineering: Learning the fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Learning

## Skills üõ†Ô∏è

- <b>Python</b>: Proficient in developing efficient, readable, and scalable code.
- <b>Solidity</b>: Familiar with the basics of smart contract development.
- <b>Infrastructure Analysis</b>: Experienced in analyzing and improving IT infrastructure.
- <b>Manual QA</b>: Many years working in Manual QA testing and shipping CRM's and Healthcare Software
