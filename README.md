## About Me üìù
I'm a former Infrastructure Analyst turned aspiring software developer, navigating my way through the ever-evolving tech world. My journey started over a year ago, beginning with Solidity and eventually shifting focus to Python. While backend development feels more natural, I'm pushing myself to get better at front-end too.

I love diving into projects as a way to learn‚Äîit keeps things practical and helps me grow my skills. Right now, I‚Äôm working on sharpening my fundamentals and learning how to iterate better with every step. My ultimate goal? To build cool things, improve every day, and eventually contribute to Machine Learning and decentralized technologies.

## Current Focus üéØ
REST Api's: I enjoy building and maintaining API's, a skill I hope to get better and better at.
Embedded: I am intimidated by low level languages but it is a goal i strive to accomplish.
Web Development: Learning how to create functional and user-friendly front-end interfaces with any number of JS frameworks.
Networking: Establishing strong relationships with like minded engineers to continue to push and challenge myself.

Skills üõ†Ô∏è
Python: Writing clean, scalable code.
Javascript: Experience with plain JS, learning more frameworks.
C#/.NET: Improving my skillset by bulding winapps and web servers.
