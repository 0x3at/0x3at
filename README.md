## About Me 📝

My technical experience began with infrastructure engineering and onto product management, now navigating my way through the fascinating world of software development. My journey is fueled by a deep interest in Web 3 and Public Blockchains, areas I believe hold the key to the next generation of <b>distributed innovation</b>.

In my quest to understand and contribute to this field, I run a public newsletter, [The Wavepool](#https://bowtiedwave.substack.com/), where I delve into the intricacies of blockchain technology and the Ethereum ecosystem. This platform serves as a beacon for those interested in these topics, providing insights and fostering discussions about the latest developments and trends.

My learning approach is project-oriented, a method I find particularly effective for gaining practical experience and understanding. I am engaged in building a variety of applications, ranging from Twitter bots to other utilitarian software. This hands-on approach allows me to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, enhancing my understanding and honing my skills.

## My Tech Stack 💻

My primary programming language is Python. I also have some proficiency in reading Solidity.

## Current Learning Focus 🎯

- Advanced Python: To deepen my understanding and broaden my capabilities with the end goal of being able to contribute to Machine Learning.
- Solidity: To gain a more comprehensive understanding of smart contract development, and how immutable systems can be used to solve current problems.
